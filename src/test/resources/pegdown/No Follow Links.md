# No Follow Links

Autolinks are simple URIs like http://www.parboiled.org,
which will be automatically "activated" by pegdown.

pegdown tries to be smart and not include trailing
punctuation marks like commas and such in the email
and URI links (joe@somewhere.com is such an example).
ftp://somesite.org:1234: this would be another one!

This is a [regular](http://regular.com) link and
[this one here][] is a reference link.

  [this one here]: http://blabla.com
